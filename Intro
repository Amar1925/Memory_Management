Memory Management consists of memory cells which contain 1 byte of binary information
Memory Management is related to writing memory Efficient Code.If improper memory management takes place it leads to slowness in application and server components.
Memory allocation is the process in which the memory manager finds some free space and provides it to the application.
2 types of virtual memory works while executing programs: 1. Static Memory Allocation 2. Dynamic memory Allocation
Static Memory allocation happens at compile time. However, we cannot use the memory again in the further program.
Eg.static int a=10;
Dynamic Memory allocation allocates the memory at the runtime to the program.
Eg.int *a;  
p = new int; 
The default Python implementation, CPython, which is written in the C programming language.
Important terms
Stack Memory: When a method is called in python, stack frames handle all variables of the method. After method is returned the stack frame is automatically destroyed.
Heap Memory:
All objects and instance variables are stored in heap memory
Heap memory enables these variables to be accessed globally.
Memory Leak: Memory leak occurs when programmers create a memory in heap and forget to delete it.
Memory leaks are particularly serious issues for programs like daemons and servers, which by definition, never terminate.
